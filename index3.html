    <h1>Mount Roraima</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Mount Roraima is one of the most magical-looking mountains on Earth. Located at the junction of Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana, it has flat-topped cliffs and sheer sides that inspired the movie “Up” and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s novel The Lost World.
    <br>
    <br>
    It’s surrounded by mystery and ancient myths from local tribes. Due to its isolated ecosystem, the summit has unique plants and animals that exist nowhere else on Earth! It's like nature’s hidden garden in the sky.

    <h3>Interesting fact :</h3>
    <p>
    Mount Roraima inspired "Paradise Falls" in Disney’s UP and the floating mountains in Avatar! It’s often called a “lost world” because of its otherworldly summit.
