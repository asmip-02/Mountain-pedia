    <h1>Mouna Kea</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Mauna Kea is the tallest mountain in the world — if you measure from its base on the ocean floor! It stands over 10,000 meters tall (even taller than Everest from base to summit), though only 4,207 meters are above sea level.
    <br>
    <br>
    It’s a dormant volcano and one of the best places on Earth for stargazing. The summit has some of the world’s most advanced observatories. In Hawaiian culture, Mauna Kea is sacred, believed to be the dwelling place of gods and ancestors.</p>
    <h3>Interesting fact :</h3>
    <p>Mauna Kea is taller than Mount Everest if measured from its underwater base, making it the tallest mountain on Earth — just mostly hidden below the sea!</p>
