    <h1>Table Mountain</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Table Mountain is famous for its flat top — like an actual table! It overlooks Cape Town and is often covered in a cloud formation called the “tablecloth,” which forms when moist air rises up the slopes and condenses.
    <br>
    <br>
        This mountain is one of the new 7 wonders of nature and is over 260 million years old — older than the Andes and the Alps! You can hike it or take a cable car up, and the view from the top is absolutely stunning.

    <h3>Interesting fact :</h3>
    <p>
        Table Mountain has its own unique cloud “tablecloth” that forms mysteriously and looks like a sheet draped over the top — it’s actually a natural meteorological phenomenon!
