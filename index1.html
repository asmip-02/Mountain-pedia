      Mount Olympus is the mythical home of the Greek gods, including Zeus, Hera, and Poseidon. Standing at 2,918 meters, it’s the highest mountain in Greece and has been a symbol of divine power since ancient times.
      Its unique biodiversity makes it a national park with rare plants and animals. Hikers love its mystical vibe and cloud-covered peaks — many say it still feels like the gods are watching! ⚡👑
