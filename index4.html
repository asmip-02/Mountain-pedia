    <h1>Mount Etna</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Mount Etna, located in Sicily, is Europe’s most active volcano and one of the world’s most studied ones. It’s in near-constant activity, with frequent eruptions that shape the landscape and fascinate scientists.
    <br>
    <br>
    It’s also a UNESCO World Heritage site and has been erupting for over 500,000 years! Locals call it “Mongibello” (beautiful mountain), and it’s both feared and respected for its power and beauty.</p>

    <h3>Interesting fact :</h3>
    <p>Ancient Romans believed Mount Etna was the forging workshop of Vulcan, the god of fire and blacksmithing, and that giants were trapped beneath it!</p>
