    <h1>Himalayas</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The Himalayas are home to the world’s tallest peak — Mount Everest — and stretch across five countries: India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, and Pakistan. They were formed when the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate, and they are still rising by about 5mm per year!

    The word Himalaya means “abode of snow” in Sanskrit. These mountains have huge cultural significance in Hinduism and Buddhism and are considered the home of gods, especially Shiva who is believed to reside on Mount Kailash.</p>

    <h3>Interesting fact :</h3>
    <p>Mount Everest grows about 4 mm taller every year due to tectonic activity — yep, it's slowly stretching toward the stars!</p>
